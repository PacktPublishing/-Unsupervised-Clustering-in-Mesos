# Unsupervised Clustering in Mesos [Integrated Course]
This is the code repository for [Unsupervised Clustering in Mesos [Integrated Course]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/unsupervised-clustering-mesos-integrated-course?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788479677), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Apache Mesos is an open source cluster manager that handles workloads in a distributed environment through dynamic resource sharing and isolation. Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.
This course begins with an introduction to Inference matroids wherein you will learn about vertex combiners with Hama, Graph Isomorphism, Soliton, and DAGs. Then you will learn to perform granular synthesis with druid streams and to write custom isolator module for Mesos. Next, you will be introduced to RoBo and will learn to manifold the cluster trees. Then you will understand what Pythonic Clojars and Monads are. Further, you will become familiar with the actor dining model and port mappings. Finally, you will learn to auto-scale clusters.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
This course is for distributed data center enthusiasts and Mesos professionals in the industry with a strong foundation in stochastic calculus, statistical learning, pattern recognition, algorithms, and data structures with graphs, queues, heaps, stacks, and more. Also, you should have a proficient working knowledge of search algorithms, linear optimization, and dynamic programming. Some knowledge of Software Engineering principles—such as finite state machines, priority queues, linked lists, adjacency lists, hash tables, BFS, DFS, and cellular automats—will be beneficial.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
Linux (64 Bit) and Mac OS X (64 Bit). 
To build Mesos from source, GCC 4.8.1+ or Clang 3.5+ is required. 
On Linux, a kernel version >= 2.6.28 is required at both build time and run time.
